# Convolutional Wasserstein Via Firedrake

Solving quadratic cost convolutional wasserstein by solving the heat equation in Firedrake. The mathematical motivation for this is written up in notes as a latex pdf.

## Setup

To run this project it is necessary to [install Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/install.html). This will depend on your system and whether you've installed firedrake/PetSc before.
